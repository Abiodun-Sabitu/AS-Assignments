			<summary>My Goals for the School of Engineering</summary>
			<p>
				Goals for the School of Engineering
				My primary goal at the School of Engineering is to master backend technologies that enable
				<br>me to build robust,

				scalable, and secure web applications. This includes gaining a deeper understanding of databases, APIs, <br>
				and server-side architectures. By the end of the program, I aim to create end-to-end solutions that <br>
				provide seamless integration between frontend interfaces and backend systems, ensuring a superior user
				experience
			</p>
			<p>
				I also aspire to strengthen my problem-solving abilities by working on collaborative projects that simulate <br>
				real-world challenges. Engaging in these projects will help me develop a portfolio of impactful solutions that
				<br>
				showcase my backend engineering skills. Furthermore, I intend to explore opportunities for mentorship and <br>
				networking within AltSchool’s ecosystem to foster meaningful connections that can propel my career forward.
			</p>
			Lastly, my long-term goal is to contribute to the tech community by sharing knowledge and collaborating on
			initiatives <br>
			that drive innovation and inclusivity in the software development industry. With the skills and experiences gained
			from <br>
			the School of Engineering, I aim to transition into full-stack roles, where I can leverage both frontend and
			backend <br>
			expertise to deliver impactful digital experiences that align with business objectives.
